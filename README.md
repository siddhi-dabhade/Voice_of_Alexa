# Voice_of_Alexa
I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed the project of building my very own Alexa-style voice assistant! Leveraging the capabilities of two powerful libraries, SpeechRecognition and Python Text-To-Speech (pyttsx3), I've created a fully functional voice-controlled assistant right on my computer.
